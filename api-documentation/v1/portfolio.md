# Portfolio API

**Base path:** `/api/v1/portfolio`

All four resources require a valid Tradeboard API key. Portfolio analysis is read-only and never places orders.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Authentication | Success response |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/benchmarks?apikey=...` | Valid API key | JSON benchmark inventory |
| POST | `/backtest` | `apikey` in JSON | Full JSON analysis |
| POST | `/tearsheet` | `apikey` in JSON | Downloadable HTML |
| POST | `/holdings` | `apikey` in JSON plus active broker session | Current-holdings summary and analysis |

The heavier JSON endpoints use `PORTFOLIO_API_RATE_LIMIT`, which defaults to `10 per minute`. Tearsheet rendering uses `PORTFOLIO_TEARSHEET_RATE_LIMIT`, which defaults to `5 per minute`. `/benchmarks` uses the shared API limit.

## GET `/benchmarks`

Reads available index symbols from the downloaded instrument master. The list therefore varies by broker and master-contract coverage.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {"symbol": "NIFTY", "exchange": "NSE_INDEX", "name": "Nifty 50"}
  ]
}
```

## POST `/backtest`

```json
{
  "apikey": "YOUR_TRADEBOARD_API_KEY",
  "holdings": [
    {"symbol": "INFY", "exchange": "NSE", "weight": 40},
    {"symbol": "HDFCBANK", "exchange": "NSE", "weight": 60}
  ],
  "start_date": "2021-01-01",
  "end_date": "2026-01-01",
  "benchmark": "NIFTY",
  "benchmark_exchange": "NSE_INDEX",
  "rebalance": "quarterly",
  "drift_band": 0.05,

### Request fields

| Field | Required | Contract | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apikey` | Yes | Valid Tradeboard API key | - |
| `holdings` | Yes | 1-50 unique holdings | - |
| `holdings[].symbol` | Yes | 1-64 characters, normalized uppercase | - |
| `holdings[].exchange` | No | `NSE` or `BSE` | `NSE` |
| `holdings[].weight` | Yes | Non-negative number; weights are normalized by ratio | - |
| `start_date`, `end_date` | Yes | Date strings accepted by the history layer | - |
| `benchmark` | No | Index symbol or `null` | `null` |
| `benchmark_exchange` | No | `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`, or `GLOBAL_INDEX` | `NSE_INDEX` |
| `rebalance` | No | `never`, `monthly`, `quarterly`, or `yearly` | `never` |
| `drift_band` | No | Fraction from `0` through `0.99` | `0` |
| `cost_model` | No | `indian_equity` or `flat_bps` | `indian_equity` |
| `brokerage_pct` | No | Brokerage as a fraction from `0` through `0.05` | `0` |
| `cost_exchange` | No | `NSE` or `BSE`; which exchange's transaction charge applies | `NSE` |
| `charges` | No | Nested object of per-charge overrides, `{"<group>": {"<charge>": <rate or null>}}`. Rates must be non-negative | `{}` |
| `gst_rate` | No | GST as a fraction from `0` through `1`, or `null` to use the built-in rate | `null` |
| `cost_bps` | No | Flat cost from 0 through 1000 basis points | `0` |
| `slippage` | No | Fraction from `0` through `0.1` | `0` |
| `initial_capital` | No | Positive number | `100000` |
| `risk_free_rate` | No | Fraction from `0` through `0.5` | `0` |
| `source` | No | `db` or `api` | `db` |

`PortfolioBacktestSchema` does not allow unknown fields: any key outside this list returns HTTP 400.

`charges` and `gst_rate` exist because statutory rates change with the budget and differ by market. Leave them out to use the built-in Indian delivery-equity schedule.

`source=db` reads local Historify data and still requires a valid Tradeboard API key. `source=api` also requires an active broker session and calls broker history sequentially.

The success response contains the complete simulation generation, including equity, benchmark, metrics, holding contributions, correlations, diversification, allocation, costs, rebalancing, walk-forward, Monte Carlo, crisis, health, and insight sections.

## POST `/tearsheet`

Accepts the same request shape as `/backtest`. Success returns a self-contained HTML attachment:

```text
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="portfolio-tearsheet.html"
```

## POST `/holdings`

```json
{
  "apikey": "YOUR_TRADEBOARD_API_KEY",
  "lookback_days": 365,
  "benchmark": "NIFTY",
  "benchmark_exchange": "NSE_INDEX",
  "risk_free_rate": 0.06,
  "source": "db"
}
```

`/holdings` uses its own schema, which accepts only these six fields; anything else returns HTTP 400.

| Field | Required | Contract | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apikey` | Yes | Valid Tradeboard API key | - |
| `lookback_days` | No | Integer from 60 through 3650 | `365` |
| `benchmark` | No | Index symbol or `null` | `NIFTY` |
| `benchmark_exchange` | No | `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`, or `GLOBAL_INDEX` | `NSE_INDEX` |
| `risk_free_rate` | No | Fraction from `0` through `0.5` | `0` |
| `source` | No | `db` or `api` | `db` |

Unlike `/backtest`, `benchmark` here defaults to `NIFTY` rather than `null`. There is no `holdings` array: the positions come from the broker. This endpoint always needs an active broker session to read current holdings. Historical prices then come from the selected `db` or `api` source.

The result is a historical scenario for today's market-value allocation, not the account's actual performance. The holdings response does not contain purchase dates or cash flows, so the service cannot reconstruct realized returns.

## Errors

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 400 | Invalid schema, duplicate symbols, weights, dates, or cost policy |
| 403 | Invalid API key or required broker session absent |
| 422 | Missing/incompatible history or no usable current holdings |
| 429 | Configured rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Unexpected internal failure |

A missing benchmark can leave benchmark-relative sections empty without invalidating an otherwise usable portfolio simulation.
