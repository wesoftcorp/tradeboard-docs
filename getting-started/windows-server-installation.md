# Windows Server Installation

Windows Server Installation (Updated)

Why Choose a Server over a Desktop?

* Reliability and Stability: Servers provide a stable and dedicated environment for your trading software. Unlike a desktop, servers are designed for constant operation and are less susceptible to disruptions like power outages, system crashes, or internet issues.
* Scalability: If your trading algorithms become more complex or require access to vast amounts of data, you can easily scale up your server resources to accommodate those needs.
* Security: Servers offer enhanced security measures to protect your trading strategies and data. You can control access, enforce strict firewall rules, and implement encryption protocols for better data protection.
* Accessibility: You can access your server and trading platform remotely, regardless of your location. This allows for greater flexibility and control over your operations.

This updated guide focuses on a minimal, high-performance installation of Tradeboard on a Windows Server (Vultr/AWS/Azure), specifically targeting regions like Mumbai for optimal trading latency. It introduces the uv package manager for significantly faster dependency management compared to standard pip.

Step-by-Step Installation Process:

1. Deploy a Cloud Instance: Deploy a Windows Server 2022 instance via your preferred cloud provider. For Indian markets, choose the Mumbai data center. A minimum of 8GB RAM is recommended.
2. Access via RDP: Log into your instance using the Remote Desktop Connection tool with the Administrator credentials provided by your cloud console.
3. Install Google Chrome: Open the default browser (Edge) to download and install Google Chrome for a better browsing experience on the server.
4. Install Visual C++ Redistributable: Download and install the latest VC++ Redistributable (both x86 and x64). This is essential for libraries like Numba, which Tradeboard uses for high-performance calculations.
5. Install Python: Download Python 3.12 or newer from python.org. Tradeboard requires `>=3.12` and will not start on an older interpreter. Important: During installation, ensure you check the box "Add python.exe to PATH".
6. Install Git: Download and install Git for Windows from git-scm.com. This is required to clone and update the Tradeboard source code.
7.  Install uv Package Manager: Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator and install uv:

    ```powershell
    pip install uv
    ```
8.  Download Tradeboard: Navigate to your C: drive and clone the repository:

    ```powershell
    cd C:\
    git clone https://github.com/wesoftcorp/tradeboard-docs
    ```
9.  Configure the .env File:

    ```powershell
    cd tradeboard
    Copy-Item .sample.env .env
    notepad .env
    ```

    Enter your `BROKER_API_KEY` and `BROKER_API_SECRET`, then save and close. Leave `APP_KEY`, `API_KEY_PEPPER` and `FERNET_SALT` at their `TRADEBOARD_PLACEHOLDER_...` values: Tradeboard replaces them with fresh random secrets on first start.
10. Set Server Timezone: For Indian markets, adjust your server time settings to (UTC +05:30) Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi. Ensure you click "Sync now" to align with exchange timings.
11. Update Static IP at Broker: Copy your server's Public IP address. Log in to your broker's API portal and whitelist this IP in your App settings. This is a critical security step required by most brokers.
12. Initial Launch:

    ```powershell
    uv run app.py
    ```

    The first launch takes a few minutes while uv builds the virtual environment and resolves the locked dependency set (208 packages). The startup banner then reports the web app on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and the WebSocket proxy on `ws://127.0.0.1:8765`.

Node.js is not required. The repository ships the pre-built React frontend in `frontend/dist`.

Create a One-Click Launch Script

To simplify the startup process, you can create a PowerShell script on your desktop:

1. Open Notepad and paste the following code:

```powershell
# Start Tradeboard using uv on Windows Server 2022

$TradeboardPath = "C:\tradeboard"

Write-Host "Starting Tradeboard..."
Write-Host "Folder: $TradeboardPath"

# Go to Tradeboard folder
Set-Location $TradeboardPath

# Check uv is available
if (-not (Get-Command uv -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    Write-Host "ERROR: uv is not installed or not available in PATH." -ForegroundColor Red
    exit 1
}

# Run Tradeboard
uv run app.py
```

2. Save the file to your Desktop as StartTradeboard.ps1.
3. To start Tradeboard, Right-click the file and select "Run with PowerShell".
