# Ubuntu Server Installation

###

#### Prerequisites

**System Requirements**

* Ubuntu Server (22.04 LTS or later recommended)
* Minimum 2 GB RAM (or 0.5 GB + 2 GB swap, the installer auto-creates the swap file if needed)
* 1 GB free disk
* 1 vCPU
* Clean installation recommended

Tradeboard runs on Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian, RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Amazon Linux, Fedora, and Arch  -  the installation script auto-detects the distro and uses the right package manager. The flow below uses Ubuntu as the example.

**Domain and DNS Setup (Required)**

1. **Cloudflare Account Setup**
   * Create a Cloudflare account if you don't have one
   * Add your domain to Cloudflare
   * Update your domain's nameservers to Cloudflare's nameservers
2. **DNS Configuration**
   *   Add an A record pointing to your server's IP address

       ```
       Type: A
       Name: yourdomain.com
       Content: YOUR_SERVER_IP
       Proxy status: Proxied
       ```
   *   Add a CNAME record for `www` (optional, not required for `sub.yourdomain.com`)

       ```
       Type: CNAME
       Name: www
       Content: yourdomain.com
       Proxy status: Proxied
       ```
3. **SSL/TLS Configuration in Cloudflare**
   * Go to SSL/TLS section
   * Set encryption mode to **Full (strict)**

**Broker Setup (Required)**

* Obtain your broker's API credentials per the Tradeboard documentation:
  * API Key
  * API Secret
* Prepare the redirect URL based on your domain and broker name:

```
# Example - root domain yourdomain.com with Zerodha
https://yourdomain.com/zerodha/callback

# Example - subdomain sub.yourdomain.com with Angel
https://sub.yourdomain.com/angel/callback
```

#### Login to the Ubuntu Server

```bash
# Connect to your Ubuntu server via SSH
# Example: ssh root@134.56.76.23

ssh user@your_server_ip
```

#### Installation Steps

**1. Download the Installation Script**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/tradeboard-install
cd ~/tradeboard-install

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marketcalls/tradeboard/main/install/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
```

**2. Run the Installation Script**

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

The script will interactively prompt you for:

* Your domain name (root domains and subdomains both supported)
* Broker selection from the 36 installed plugins
* Broker API credentials (Key + Secret)
* For XTS-based brokers (5paisa XTS, Compositedge, IIFL, etc.): additional market-data API key/secret
* **Enable Remote MCP?** (y/N), opt-in to expose `/mcp` and `/oauth/*` for hosted AI clients (Claude.ai, ChatGPT) at the same domain. You can also enable this later from the admin UI

The installer will:

* Detect your distro (Ubuntu / Debian / RHEL / Fedora / Arch / Amazon Linux) and use the right package manager
* Install required packages, including Chromium (used for Telegram /chart rendering, non-fatal if unavailable)
* Install the `uv` package manager (via snap on Ubuntu, or the Astral standalone installer on PEP 668 systems like Ubuntu 24.04+)
* Configure Nginx with HTTPS via Let's Encrypt (Certbot)
* Set up the Tradeboard application under `/var/python/tradeboard`
* Create the systemd unit `tradeboard.service`
* Generate timestamped installation logs in `~/tradeboard-install/logs/`

**Default Layout (single deployment)**

After a successful run, the install lives at:

```
/var/python/tradeboard/                  cloned repo
/var/python/tradeboard/.venv/            uv-managed Python virtual environment
/var/python/tradeboard/.env              configuration
/var/python/tradeboard/tradeboard.sock     Gunicorn Unix socket
/etc/systemd/system/tradeboard.service   systemd unit
/etc/nginx/sites-available/tradeboard.conf   Nginx vhost (stable name across domain changes)
```

The Nginx vhost name `tradeboard.conf` is intentionally fixed, `install/change-domain.sh` updates `server_name` in place rather than renaming the file.

**Multi-Domain Deployment (Optional)**

The default `install.sh` is single-deploy per server. If you need 2+ Tradeboard instances side by side (different broker per instance, etc.), use the dedicated multi-deploy installer:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marketcalls/tradeboard/main/install/install-multi.sh
chmod +x install-multi.sh
sudo ./install-multi.sh
```

`install-multi.sh` asks how many instances you want, then collects a domain, broker and credentials for each. Instances are numbered, not named after the domain:

```
/var/python/tradeboard-flask/tradeboard1/        instance 1 repo
/var/python/tradeboard-flask/tradeboard1/venv/   its virtual environment
/var/python/tradeboard-flask/tradeboard1/.env    its configuration
tradeboard1.service                            its systemd unit
/etc/nginx/sites-available/<domain>          its nginx vhost, named after the domain
```

Each instance also gets its own ports, allocated in sequence from the single-deploy defaults:

| Instance | Flask | WebSocket | ZeroMQ |
| -------- | ----- | --------- | ------ |
| 1        | 5000  | 8765      | 5555   |
| 2        | 5001  | 8766      | 5556   |
| 3        | 5002  | 8767      | 5557   |

Each deployment gets its own service, configuration, virtual environment, SSL certificate, and log file.

::: warning
`install/update.sh` currently detects the single-deploy layout at `/var/python/tradeboard` and an older multi-deploy layout of the form `/var/python/tradeboard-flask/<name>/tradeboard/` with a service called `tradeboard-<name>`. It does not recognise the `tradeboard1`, `tradeboard2` directories that the current `install-multi.sh` creates. Update those instances by hand: `cd /var/python/tradeboard-flask/tradeboard1 && sudo git pull`, re-sync dependencies, then `sudo systemctl restart tradeboard1`.
:::

**3. Verify the Installation**

1.  **Check service status**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status tradeboard
    ```
2.  **Test the Nginx configuration**

    ```bash
    sudo nginx -t
    ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/tradeboard.conf
    ```
3. **Open the dashboard** at `https://yourdomain.com`
4.  **View installation log**

    ```bash
    ls -l ~/tradeboard-install/logs/
    cat ~/tradeboard-install/logs/install_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
    ```

#### Remote MCP

Remote MCP exposes `/mcp` and `/oauth/*` so hosted AI clients (claude.ai, chatgpt.com) can connect to your Tradeboard install over HTTPS. Local stdio MCP (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf) is unaffected, it works regardless of this setting.

You can enable Remote MCP two ways:

1. **At install time**, answer `y` when `install.sh` prompts. The installer sets `MCP_HTTP_ENABLED='True'` and `MCP_PUBLIC_URL='https://yourdomain.com'` in `.env` for you.
2.  **From the admin UI**, visit `https://yourdomain.com/admin/remote-mcp`. The settings card at the top of the page lets you flip Remote MCP on or off, edit the public HTTPS origin, and adjust the OAuth posture toggles. Saving writes the new values to `.env`; a yellow banner then prompts you to restart the service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart tradeboard
    ```

    The banner clears automatically once the running process picks up the new values.

**Available Toggles**

| Toggle                      | `.env` key                      | Default                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Remote MCP enabled          | `MCP_HTTP_ENABLED`              | `False`                   |
| Auto-approve hosted clients | `MCP_OAUTH_REQUIRE_APPROVAL`    | `False` (auto-approve ON) |
| Allow order placement       | `MCP_OAUTH_WRITE_SCOPE_ENABLED` | `True`                    |

The MCP URL to give your AI client is the same as your dashboard URL with `/mcp` appended, e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/mcp`. The admin page displays it with a copy button when MCP is configured.

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**

1.  **SSL certificate issues**

    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -u certbot

    # Re-run Certbot manually
    sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
    ```
2.  **Application not starting**

    ```bash
    # View live logs
    sudo journalctl -fu tradeboard

    # Last 100 lines
    sudo journalctl -n 100 -u tradeboard

    # Restart
    sudo systemctl restart tradeboard
    ```
3.  **Nginx issues**

    ```bash
    # Test config
    sudo nginx -t

    # Error log
    sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

    # Access log
    sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

    # Reload after config changes
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```
4.  **Installation logs**

    ```bash
    ls -l ~/tradeboard-install/logs/
    cat ~/tradeboard-install/logs/$(ls -t ~/tradeboard-install/logs/ | head -1)
    ```
5.  **`uv` install failed with `externally-managed-environment`**

    This is PEP 668 enforcement on Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 12+. The current `install.sh` falls through to the Astral standalone installer automatically; if you're on an older copy, refresh the script and re-run:

    ```bash
    cd ~/tradeboard-install
    rm -f install.sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marketcalls/tradeboard/main/install/install.sh
    chmod +x install.sh
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```
6.  **Inspect the install directly**

    ```bash
    # Repo
    ls /var/python/tradeboard

    # Effective configuration
    sudo cat /var/python/tradeboard/.env

    # Application logs
    sudo tail -f /var/python/tradeboard/log/tradeboard_$(date +%F).log

    # JSON-formatted error log (always-on)
    sudo tail -f /var/python/tradeboard/log/errors.jsonl
    ```

**Multi-Domain Deployment Notes**

If you ran `install-multi.sh`, the services are numbered `tradeboard1`, `tradeboard2` and so on:

```bash
# List all Tradeboard services on this host
systemctl list-units 'tradeboard*'

# Manage a specific instance
sudo systemctl status tradeboard1
sudo journalctl -fu tradeboard1

# Per-instance install directories
ls /var/python/tradeboard-flask/
```

#### Updating

```bash
cd ~/tradeboard-install
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marketcalls/tradeboard/main/install/update.sh
chmod +x update.sh
sudo ./update.sh
```

The update script backs up every database to a timestamped `db/backup_<timestamp>/` folder, runs `git pull`, reports any new variables found in `.sample.env`, re-installs dependencies from `requirements-nginx.txt` into the deployment's virtual environment, runs `upgrade/migrate_all.py`, and restarts the service. Your `.env` is never overwritten.

It detects the single-deploy layout at `/var/python/tradeboard` first and falls back to scanning `/var/python/tradeboard-flask/` for the legacy `<name>/tradeboard/` layout, asking which to update when several are present.

#### Changing the Domain

```bash
cd ~/tradeboard-install
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marketcalls/tradeboard/main/install/change-domain.sh
chmod +x change-domain.sh
sudo ./change-domain.sh
```

The script updates `.env` (`HOST_SERVER`, `WEBSOCKET_URL`), the Nginx vhost's `server_name`, requests a new Let's Encrypt certificate for the new domain, and restarts the service.

#### Security Notes

1.  **Firewall**

    The installer configures UFW to allow only SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS. Open additional ports as needed:

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow <port_number>
    ```
2. **SSL/TLS**
   * Certificates are auto-renewed by Certbot
   * The Nginx vhost uses TLS 1.2/1.3, modern ciphers, OCSP stapling, and HSTS
   *   Keep the system patched:

       ```bash
       sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
       ```
3.  **`.env` file**

    Contains `APP_KEY`, `API_KEY_PEPPER`, and broker credentials. The installer sets `chmod 600` on it and ownership to the service user (`www-data` on Ubuntu/Debian, `nginx` on RHEL, `http` on Arch). Never commit this file or expose it via Nginx.
4.  **Auto-logout**

    Indian broker tokens expire daily at \~3:00 AM IST and the app forces a re-login at that time. For 24/7 crypto brokers (Delta Exchange), the installer detects this and disables the auto-logout.
5.  **Single user per deployment**

    Tradeboard is designed for one trader per server. There is no multi-user model, server access equals full control of the broker session. Don't share the host.

#### Post-Installation

1. Configure your broker login on the dashboard
2. Set up monitoring and Telegram alerts if desired
3. Periodically review `log/errors.jsonl` for issues
4. Apply security updates regularly
