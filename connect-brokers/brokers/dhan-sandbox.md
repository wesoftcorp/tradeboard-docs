# Dhan(Sandbox)

**What is Dhan SandBox API?**

Dhan SandBox API is a simulated testing environment designed for developers and traders to experiment with Dhan’s trading and market data APIs without needing a live brokerage account or actual capital. It replicates the real trading environment but ensures zero risk by not executing trades on the actual exchange. It is ideal for testing integrations, validating order logic, and experimenting with strategies.

**Who Should Integrate Dhan SandBox API with Tradeboard?**

Tradeboard is an open-source algo trading automation framework that connects with platforms like TradingView, Amibroker, and custom dashboards. Integrating Dhan’s SandBox API with Tradeboard is highly recommended for:

* **Algo Developers** building broker connectors.
* **Traders** who want to simulate real-time automated strategies before going live.
* **Educators and Trainers** who want a safe demo environment.
* **Early-stage Fintech Builders** exploring trading APIs.
* **QA and Support Teams** needing to replicate live bugs or behaviors in a controlled setup.

#### 4. **Access Your Sandbox Token and Client ID**

Once inside, go to the **Sandbox** tab. You’ll see:

* Application Name (e.g., `tradeboard`)
* **Access Token** (JWT for authorization)
* **Client ID** (unique to your application)
* API Playground and documentation links

These credentials are what you will use inside Tradeboard’s configuration or `.env` file to test trading orders programmatically.

***

#### Retrieve API Credentials

Once you've successfully logged into the DhanHQ DevPortal and created your sandbox application:

1. **Copy the Client ID**
   * This is your `BROKER_API_KEY`
   * It uniquely identifies your application (e.g., `2505178942`)
2. **Copy the Access Token**
   * This is your `BROKER_API_SECRET`

It acts like a password (JWT format) to authenticate your API requests.

#### Configuration for Tradeboard

Inside your Tradeboard project (or any backend using Dhan APIs), create or update the `.env` file with the following keys:

```bash
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_dhan_sandbox_clientid_here' 
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_dhan_sandbox_token_here' 
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/dhan_sandbox/callback'
```

::: info
The broker code is `dhan_sandbox`, with an underscore. It is a separate plugin from [Dhan](dhan.md), so switching between live and sandbox means changing `REDIRECT_URL` as well as the credentials.

`BROKER_API_KEY` accepts either a bare client ID, as shown above, or the composite `client_id:::api_key` form used by the live Dhan plugin. Clicking **Connect** does not open a Dhan login page: Tradeboard authenticates with the access token in `BROKER_API_SECRET` directly.

**Summary: Why It Matters for Tradeboard**

Integrating Dhan SandBox with Tradeboard means:

* Safer testing for order placement, cancellation, and position handling.
* No compliance delay since no KYC is needed.
* Faster debugging and integration turnaround.
* Enables workshops, testing, and community support for algo development.

By setting up your sandbox environment with Dhan and Tradeboard, you accelerate your readiness for live algorithmic trading while ensuring a risk-free development experience.

### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/dhan_sandbox/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`, `CDS`, `BCD`, `MCX`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`
