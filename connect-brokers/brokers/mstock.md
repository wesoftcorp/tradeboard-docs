# Mstock

MStock is a modern Indian stock broker by Mirae Asset, offering commission-free trading and robust REST-based APIs. These APIs enable traders and developers to automate trading, retrieve account information, and integrate market data seamlessly. By connecting mStock OpenAPI with Tradeboard, algo traders can efficiently execute strategies, manage positions, and automate workflows.

For developers and algo traders looking to use the mStock API, the integration process involves the following steps:

### **Step-by-Step Integration**

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Trading Credentials**

Ensure you have your mStock **Client Code** (Login ID) and **Trading Password** ready.

You will also need access to your registered mobile number/email for OTP verification unless TOTP is enabled.

#### **Step 2: Register for API Access**

mStock provides API access via its OpenAPI portal.

#### Configuration: <a href="#configuration" id="configuration"></a>

Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file for mstock's API:

```
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_mstock_unique_client_code'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_mstock_api_key_generated'
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/mstock/callback'
```

Integrating with **mstock APIs** unlocks the ability to automate strategies, execute trades, and analyze data directly within your own infrastructure. When used with **Tradeboard**, you can self-host and run your entire algo trading stack, with full control and zero vendor lock-in.

### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/mstock/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`, `CDS`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`
