# Firstock

Firstock is an Indian discount brokerage firm. Known for its user-friendly interface, Firstock provides mobile, web, and desktop platforms equipped with essential features like real-time market data, advanced charting tools, and order execution capabilities. Its competitive pricing structure and support for algorithmic trading make it an attractive option for both retail and professional traders.

Through Tradeboard, the Firstock plugin covers equity and equity derivatives on NSE and BSE. Currency (CDS) and commodity (MCX) segments are not part of this integration, so use a plugin that reports those exchanges if you trade them.

3\. Configure Tradeboard:

• In your Tradeboard .env file, set the following variables:

```bash
BROKER_API_KEY = 'Your Vendor Code'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'Your API Key'
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/firstock/callback'
```

### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/firstock/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`
