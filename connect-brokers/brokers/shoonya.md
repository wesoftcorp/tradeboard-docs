### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/shoonya/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`, `CDS`, `MCX`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`
