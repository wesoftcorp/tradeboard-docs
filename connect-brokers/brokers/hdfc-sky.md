# HDFC Sky

HDFC Sky (hdfcsky.com (https://www.hdfcsky.com/)) is the discount broking and investment platform from HDFC Securities, offering equity, F\&O, currency and commodity trading with a flat-fee brokerage model. Its Open API (developer.hdfcsky.com (https://developer.hdfcsky.com/)) exposes REST and WebSocket endpoints for order placement, portfolio and funds management, and market data. Regulated by NSE, BSE and MCX, this API, used in the context of Tradeboard integration, enables automated trading strategies, real-time market data access, order management, and more.

The integration process involves logging in to the HDFC Sky Open API developer portal, creating a Trading API app, capturing the generated API Key and API Secret, and configuring them in Tradeboard's environmental variables.

Here is a sample of how the details would appear in a .env file for reference:

```

Integrating Tradeboard with HDFC Sky's Open API opens up possibilities for automated trading strategies, providing a powerful tool for traders and developers to act on market opportunities efficiently. It's essential to follow best practices for API integration, including handling rate limits, managing credentials securely, and ensuring robust error handling and logging mechanisms are in place.

### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/hdfcsky/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`, `CDS`, `MCX`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`
