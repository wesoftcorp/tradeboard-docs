1. **Generate API Key**
   * If you don’t already have an API key, generate a new one by following the on-screen instructions.
   * Note down the **App Code** and the **API Secret Key**, as both are required for configuring the `.env` file.

### Configuring the `.env` File

AliceBlue uses an OAuth redirect login. Tradeboard sends the **App Code** of the app you created to `https://ant.aliceblueonline.com/?appcode=...`, and AliceBlue calls back with an `authCode` and `userId`. Tradeboard then signs `userId + authCode + apiSecret` and exchanges the result for a session.

So `BROKER_API_KEY` holds the **App Code** of your app, not your AliceBlue login user ID. Below is a sample configuration for the `.env` file:

```
# AliceBlue Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_app_code_here'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_api_secret_here'
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/aliceblue/callback'

```

Replace `your_app_code_here` with the App Code shown for your AliceBlue app and `your_api_secret_here` with the generated API secret key.

#### Important Notes

* Ensure that your **API Secret Key** is stored securely and is not shared publicly.
* The **REDIRECT\_URL** should match the one registered with your API application.

Follow these steps to integrate AliceBlue with Tradeboard successfully. If you encounter any issues, refer to the AliceBlue API documentation for further assistance.

### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/aliceblue/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`, `CDS`, `BCD`, `MCX`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`
