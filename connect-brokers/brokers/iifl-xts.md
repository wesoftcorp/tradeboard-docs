# IIFL (XTS)

IIFL Securities provides API access through the XTS (Symphony Fintech) platform, served from `https://ttblaze.iifl.com`. Tradeboard's `iifl` plugin talks to two XTS endpoints: the Interactive API for orders, positions and holdings, and the Market Data API for quotes, depth and historical candles.

::: info
This page covers the **XTS** integration, which Tradeboard registers as the broker `iifl`. IIFL also runs a separate Markets' APIs developer portal used by the [IIFL Capital](iifl-capital.md) plugin (broker `iiflcapital`). The two are different products with different credentials. Pick the one your account is enabled for.

### Step 1: Create API Applications

Log in to the IIFL XTS developer dashboard with your IIFL credentials.

Once logged in:

1. Go to `My App` > `Create New Application`
2. Create two separate apps:

* **Interactive Order API**
* **Market Data API**

**Details to Fill:**

* **App Name**: Tradeboard
* **App Description**: Tradeboard
* **Redirect URL: (leave it empty)**
* **Company Name**: Tradeboard (or your own)
* Choose the correct **API Package** depending on the app (Order or Market Data).

Once submitted, wait for approval from the broker. After approval, the status will turn **Active**.

***

### Step 2: Setup Environment Variables

Each app issues its own App Key and Secret Key. The Interactive app's pair goes into the plain variables, the Market Data app's pair into the `_MARKET` variables. Refer to the `.sample.env` file in your Tradeboard folder and prepare your `.env` as follows:

```
# Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_BROKER_ORDER_API_KEY'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'YOUR_ORDER_API_SECRET'

BROKER_API_KEY_MARKET = 'YOUR_BROKER_MARKET_API_KEY'
BROKER_API_SECRET_MARKET = 'YOUR_BROKER_MARKET_API_SECRET'

REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/iifl/callback'
```

Replace the values with actual credentials shown on your developer dashboard once approved.

::: warning
Swapping the Interactive and Market Data pairs is the most common setup mistake. The login then succeeds but quotes stay empty, because the market data session was never established.
:::

***

### Step 3: Start Tradeboard

Once all environment variables are set and both apps are **Active**, start Tradeboard and click **Connect** on the IIFL (XTS) broker page. There is no broker login screen to complete: Tradeboard posts your App Key and Secret Key straight to the XTS session endpoint and receives the interactive token, the market data feed token and your user id in one step.

This completes the integration process for IIFL (XTS) with Tradeboard.

Integrating Tradeboard with IIFL's XTS API empowers traders and developers to automate and streamline their trading workflows with precision and speed. By using both the order execution and market data APIs, you can build robust trading systems capable of reacting to market conditions in real time. Always ensure secure handling of API credentials, implement proper error handling, and monitor your integration to maintain reliability and compliance.

### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/iifl/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`, `CDS`, `MCX`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`
