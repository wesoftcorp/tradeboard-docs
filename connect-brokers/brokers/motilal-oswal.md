#### **Configuration**

&#x20;Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file for motilal's :

```
# Motilal Oswal API Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_client_code' #Use your client code as api key
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_api_key_here'  #Use your generated API Key as API secret in .env file
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/motilal/callback'
```

### Logging in

Clicking Connect opens the Motilal Oswal login form. It asks for four values:

* **User ID**, your client code

* **TOTP**, the 6-digit code from the authenticator app you set up in Step 2
* **Date of Birth**, the 2FA date in `DD/MM/YYYY` format

Integrating with **Motilal APIs** unlocks the ability to automate strategies, execute trades, and analyze data directly within your own infrastructure. When used with **Tradeboard**, you can self-host and run your entire algo trading stack, with full control and zero vendor lock-in.

### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/motilal/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`, `CDS`, `MCX`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`
