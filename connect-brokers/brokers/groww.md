Here is how you would typically set up your environment variables in a .env file for Groww's API:

```bash
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_groww_apikey_here'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_groww_apisecret_here'
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/groww/callback'

It’s a powerful combination for automating trading decisions while using a broker trusted by millions. As with any integration, be sure to handle token management carefully, log errors effectively, and build retry mechanisms to handle token expiry and downtime.
