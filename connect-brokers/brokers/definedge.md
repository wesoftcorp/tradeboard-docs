**Configuring the .env File**

The Definedge API Token is used as the API key and API Secrets as API Secret itself. Below is a sample configuration for the .env file

```
# Definedge Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_API_Token_here'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_API_Secret_here'

```

**Important Notes**

### Supported Exchanges

Tradeboard reads this plugin's exchange list from `broker/definedge/plugin.json` and serves it to the app, so symbol search, the Strategy Builder and the tools pages only offer what the plugin actually handles.

* **Tradable:** `NSE`, `BSE`, `NFO`, `BFO`, `CDS`, `MCX`
* **Index feeds:** `NSE_INDEX`, `BSE_INDEX`
