# Tradeboard Design Documentation

This directory describes the implemented architecture of Tradeboard `2.0.2.2`. Tradeboard is a self-hosted, single-user trading application with a Flask/Flask-RESTX backend, React 19 frontend, broker plugins, a separate WebSocket proxy, sandbox execution, hosted strategies, Flow automation, portfolio analytics, chart trading, and optional local or remote MCP access.

The current inventory is 36 broker plugins: 34 securities brokers, Delta Exchange for crypto derivatives, and a Dhan sandbox plugin for paper trading. Every one of the 36 has a `plugin.json`. Broker capabilities are metadata-driven; a plugin's presence does not imply every optional broker operation is supported.

## Documentation Policy

- Code and registered routes are authoritative when a design document conflicts with an example.
- The public REST contract lives in the [API documentation](../../api-documentation/v1/README.md).
- Flask-RESTX Swagger/OpenAPI UI is intentionally disabled with `doc=False` in `restx_api/__init__.py`. Do not advertise or re-enable `/api/docs` as part of documentation maintenance.
- These pages describe implemented behavior verified against the application code and registered routes.
