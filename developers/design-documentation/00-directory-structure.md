## Request Layers

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `restx_api/` | JSON/query parsing, Marshmallow validation, HTTP response | Broker-specific business rules |
| `blueprints/` | Session-authenticated app APIs, webhooks, feature routes | Reusable broker execution logic |
| `services/` | API-key verification, mode routing, normalized orchestration | Flask page rendering |
| `broker/<key>/` | Broker authentication, request mapping, data transforms, streaming | Cross-broker product policy |
| `database/` | Persistence models, migrations, queries, cache invalidation | HTTP contracts |
| `sandbox/` | Simulated execution and account state | Live broker calls |

## Backend Inventory

`restx_api/__init__.py` mounts one Flask-RESTX `Api` on the `api_v1` blueprint at `/api/v1` and registers 47 namespaces, which expose 63 method/path pairs in total. `blueprints/` contains 52 route modules covering the larger session and feature surface for auth, admin, Flow, Historify, strategies, tools, messaging, monitoring, and the React application. `services/` currently holds 79 modules. Public REST documentation is maintained in the [API reference](../../api-documentation/v1/README.md).

The service directory currently includes order, account, market-data, option, calendar, Flow, Historify, messaging, charting, analytics, arbitrage, custom straddle, and scalping risk services. Use `rg --files services` for the live inventory instead of copying a long file list into architecture documents.

## Broker Plugin Shape

Every configured broker has `broker/<key>/plugin.json`. Common optional subtrees are:

```text
broker/<key>/
|-- plugin.json                Name, type, supported exchanges, leverage flag
|-- api/
|   |-- auth_api.py            `authenticate_broker(...)`
|   |-- order_api.py           `place_order_api(...)` and order lifecycle calls
|   |-- data.py                Quotes, depth, history, intervals
|   |-- funds.py               Margin and funds
|   |-- margin_api.py          Order margin preview
|   `-- gtt_api.py             GTT lifecycle (Dhan and Zerodha only)
|-- mapping/
|   |-- transform_data.py      Tradeboard request to broker request
|   |-- order_data.py          Broker response to Tradeboard shape
|   |-- margin_data.py
|   `-- gtt_data.py
|-- database/
|   `-- master_contract_db.py  Symbol master download and `symtoken` load
`-- streaming/
    |-- <key>_adapter.py       Market-data WebSocket adapter
    |-- <key>_order_adapter.py Order-update ingestion
    `-- <key>_mapping.py
```

Modules are imported lazily by name, not by a registry: `services/place_order_service.py` calls `importlib.import_module(f"broker.{broker_name}.api.order_api")` on each request, and `utils/plugin_loader.py` returns a `_LazyBrokerAuthDict` that imports `broker.<key>.api.auth_api` only on first access. Not every broker implements every optional file. Live GTT modules currently exist for Dhan and Zerodha only.

## Frontend Shape

```text
frontend/src/
|-- main.tsx                   Vite entry point
|-- App.tsx                    Lazy routes and auth gates
|-- app/providers.tsx          Query, theme, tooltip, Socket.IO providers
|-- api/                       Typed HTTP clients by feature
|-- pages/                     Top-level and grouped route pages
|-- components/                Layout, trading, tools, Flow, scalping, UI
|-- hooks/                     Market data, Socket.IO, visibility, risk helpers
|-- stores/                    Zustand auth, broker, session, theme, Flow state
|-- contexts/                  React contexts shared across feature trees
|-- lib/                       MarketDataManager, plotting, math, helpers
|-- utils/                     Formatting and small pure helpers
|-- config/                    Build-time and runtime front-end configuration
|-- types/                     Feature contracts
|-- assets/                    Static assets bundled by Vite
`-- test/                      Vitest setup and accessibility helpers
```

## Persistence Shape

The deployment uses six primary configured stores: main `tradeboard.db`, traffic `logs.db`, latency `latency.db`, health `health.db`, sandbox `sandbox.db`, and Historify `historify.duckdb`. Scalping tables use the main database URL. See [18 Database Structure](18-database-structure.md).
