# Why to Build with Tradeboard?

_"Why should I use Tradeboard when I can just build my strategy directly on top of the broker's SDK or API?"_

It's a common question. Many start with broker SDKs because it feels quick, just wire your signals and send orders. But soon, the pain points show up:

* How do you monitor trades in real-time?
* Where do you store and replay logs?
* How do you test webhooks or strategies before going live?
* How do you manage symbols, expiries, and contracts across brokers?
* What happens when you want to switch from Broker A to Broker B?
* Who builds the option chain, the Greeks, the payoff diagram, the scalping keys?

That's when you realize the SDK is not enough.

**Tradeboard takes care of the heavy lifting.**

It's not just an API wrapper. It's a **full-stack, open-source trading platform** you run on your own machine: a complete trading desk, not only an execution layer.

### Trade From the Platform Itself

Earlier versions of Tradeboard were mostly a bridge between your strategy and your broker. That is no longer the whole story. Tradeboard now ships its own trading surfaces, so you can trade directly from it without any external charting package.

#### Chart Trading Terminal

Fire and manage orders from the chart itself, on streaming broker WebSocket data, with **90+ indicators** available on real market data.

See [Chart Trading Terminal](new-features/trading-terminal.md).

#### Scalping Terminal

A keyboard-driven terminal built for speed: arrow keys fire CE and PE orders, **F6 flattens every position** and **F7 cancels every pending order**. There is also **FastScalper**, a separate lightweight desktop build in Rust and Tauri.

See [Scalping Terminal](new-features/fast-scalper.md).

#### Options Analytics

A full options desk is built in, with real-time Greeks and payoff diagrams:

| Tool | Tool | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strategy Builder | Strategy Portfolio | Option Chain |
| Option Greeks | OI Tracker and Range | Max Pain |
| Straddle Chart | Straddle PnL | OI Profile |
| Vol Surface | IV Smile | GEX Dashboard |
| Gamma Density | Futures Arbitrage Scanner | Portfolio Backtester |
| SIP Backtester | | |

#### Action Center

Square off, cancel, and manage open exposure from one screen, with exchange-aligned auto square-off.

See [Action Center](new-features/action-center.md).

### What Makes Tradeboard Different?

#### Strategy Management and Hosting

Host your **Python strategies directly inside Tradeboard**, alongside strategies from TradingView, Amibroker, ChartInk, MetaTrader, Excel, or custom webhooks. Start, pause, schedule, monitor, and analyze, all from a central control plane.

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Python Strategy Hosting** | Upload and run Python scripts with scheduling |
| **Flow Visual Builder** | Drag-and-drop canvas wiring 53 node types from triggers to indicators, conditions and orders |
| **Multi-Platform Support** | TradingView, Amibroker, ChartInk, Excel, and more |
| **Centralized Control** | Manage all strategies from one dashboard |
| **Process Isolation** | Hosted strategies run in separate processes |

See [Python Strategy Hosting](new-features/python-strategy-hosting.md) and [Flow](new-features/flow-visual-strategy-builder.md).

#### Sandbox Testing and API Analyzer

The **Analyzer Mode** works like a local sandbox: test signals, APIs, and strategies with 1 crore default sandbox capital without sending simulated orders to the broker. Market prices can still come from broker data services.

| Feature | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| **Sandbox Capital** | 1 crore to test freely |
| **Real Market Prices** | Realistic simulation with live data |
| **Margin Calculations** | Actual margin requirements enforced |
| **Position Tracking** | Full position and holdings management |
| **Execution Isolation** | Sandbox orders stay in the sandbox store |

See [API Analyzer](new-features/api-analyzer.md).

#### Historical Data and Backtesting

**Historify** lets you download and store historical market data locally using DuckDB. Use this data for backtesting, analysis, or feeding into your strategy development workflow. A **portfolio backtester** and **SIP backtester** are built in.

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Bulk Downloads** | Download years of OHLCV data |
| **DuckDB Storage** | Efficient columnar storage |
| **Multiple Timeframes** | 1-minute to daily data |
| **Export Options** | CSV, TXT, ZIP, or Parquet |

See [Historify](new-features/historify.md) and [Portfolio Backtester and Analyzer](new-features/portfolio-analytics.md).

#### Multi-Broker, Multi-Platform

Tradeboard ships **36 broker plugins**: 34 securities brokers, Delta Exchange for crypto derivatives, and a Dhan sandbox plugin for paper trading. The securities plugins share normalized API and WebSocket interfaces, reducing broker-specific strategy code.

See the full list under [Brokers](connect-brokers/brokers/README.md) and [Delta Exchange](crypto/exchanges/delta-exchange.md).

#### Unified Symbol and Contract Management

With Tradeboard's **Common Symbol Format**, you don't have to worry about broker-specific quirks. Contracts, expiries, and lot sizes are maintained automatically.

| Broker | Their Format | Tradeboard Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zerodha | `SBIN` | `SBIN` |
| Angel | `SBIN-EQ` | `SBIN` |
| Dhan | `SBIN` | `SBIN` |

**One Tradeboard symbol format, subject to each plugin's exchange coverage.**
